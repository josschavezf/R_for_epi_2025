# Assignment week 3: 


## Let's create a vector that contains the weight of three patients:

patients_weight <- c("John" = 198, "Andrea" = 165, "Will" = 150)

### 1) Use the patientâ€™s name to get the weight of John and Will

### 2) Use a logical evaluation to select patients with 
### a weight greater than 155 pounds


### 3) Remove Will from the vector


### 4) Add a new patient to the vector


### 5) Replace John's weight with a different number



## Let's create a matrix

my_matrix <- matrix(1:30, ncol = 6)

### 6) How would you select columns 2 to 4 with all their rows?
