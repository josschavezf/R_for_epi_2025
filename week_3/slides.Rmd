# Let's recap

- How many dimensions does a vector have?
- What types of data can we store in a vector?
- What happens if we store different types of data in a vector?
- How do we create a new vector?
- How do we access the vector elements?

---

## Using the name as index

```{r}
x <- c(1, 3, 10)
names(x)
```
--

```{r}
x <- c("number_a" = 10, 
       "number_b" = 50, 
       "number_c" = 100)
names(x)
```

---

```{r}
x <- c(10, 50, 100)

names(x) <- c("number_a", "number_b", "number_c")
x
```

--
```{r}
x["number_b"]
x[c("number_a", "number_c")]
```

---

## Using logical evaluation as index

```{r}

x <- seq(1:10)
x

x < 5

x[x < 5]
```

---

```{r}

x <- c("a", "a", "b", "c", "c", "c")

x == "c"

x[x == "c"]
```

---
Matching information

```{r}
letters == "a"

letters[letters == "a"]
```

---

```{r}
letters %in% c("a", "j", "o")

letters[letters %in% c("a", "j", "o")]
```

---
## Your turn!

The following vector shows the temperature in New York during a week:

```{r}
temperature_nyc <- c("Monday" = 55,
                     "Tuesday" = 55,
                     "Wednesday" = 66,
                     "Thursday" = 50,
                     "Friday" = 48,
                     "Saturday" = 45,
                     "Sunday" = 47)
```

- Select the temperature of the first 3 days.
- Select the temperature of Tue, Thu and Sat.
- Which days had temperatures above average?

---
## How do we modify a vector?

- Adding a new element

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
x

x[4] <- "d"
x
```

---

```{r}
x <- c(x, "e")
x
```

---
- Removing an element

```{r}
x
x[-2]
x <- x[-2]
x
```

---
## Your turn!

Using the vector:

```{r}
fruits <- c("apples" = 1, 
            "cherries" = 10,
            "mangos" = 7) 
```

- Add a new fruit to the vector

- Remove the cherries

---
- Replacing an element by index

```{r}
x
x[1] <- "m"
x
```

---
- Replacing an element by logical evaluation

```{r}
x
x[x == "d"] <- "e"
x
```

---

## Excercise

Using the vector:

```{r}
fruits <- c("apples" = 1, 
            "cherries" = 10,
            "mangos" = 7) 
```

- Select all fruits with values bigger than 5

- Replace the number of apples with a 4

# Matrices

---

# Creating a matrix

Matrices are objects with elements arranged in a two-dimensional layout.

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(data = 1:12, nrow = 4)
my_matrix
```

- rows and columns
- All elements must be the same type

---
```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(data = 1:12, ncol = 4)

my_matrix
```

---
```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(data = 1:12, 
                    ncol = 4, 
                    byrow = TRUE)

my_matrix
```

---
class: chapter-slide

# Operations with matrices

---

## Arithmetic operations

```{r}
my_matrix + 10
my_matrix * 2
```

---
## Arithmetic operations

```{r}
matrix1 <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
matrix2 <- matrix(7:12, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
matrix1
matrix2
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
matrix1 + matrix2
```
]

---
# Your turn!

- Create a matrix with numbers 101:125, arrange them in 5 rows. 

- Add 10 units, then multiply by 3

---
## How do we access matrices elements?

```{r}
matrix1 <- matrix(101:125, nrow = 5)
matrix1
matrix1[1:7]
```

---
## How do we access matrices elements?

```{r}
matrix1[1,2]
```

```{r}
matrix1[1:2,1:2]
```

---
# Your turn!

- How would you select the number 120 from the matrix?

- How would you select the last two columns?
