# Let's recap

- What's the difference between R and RStudio?
- What are the most common RStudio panels?
- What's the console for?
- How do we create a new script?
- Where do we find existing variables?
- How do we read/import a table?
- How do we visualize the table?
- How do we write/export a table?

---
# Data structures in R

- Vectors
- Matrices
- Data frames
- Lists
- Functions

---
# Choosing a good variable name

- Be clear and concise.
- When possible, use lowercase.
- Don't include special characters. Avoid dieresis and other accents (é, è, â, î or ô, tilde ñ, ü or ï)
- Use _ or Upper/Lower case to separate words, never space.
- Avoid conflicts with any R keywords (True, False, and, if, else, and other function names)

# Let's try this

What of these variable names follow good practices?

a) MY_FIRST_VARIABLE

b) OxygenLevel

c) patient_name

d) final.value

e) mean

# Vectors

---

# Creating a vector

## Using the assignment operator

Vector with a single value

```{r}
x1 <- 10
x2 <- "a"
```

---
## Using the combine function

```{r}
x <- c(1, 10, 25, 30)
x

x <- c("a", "b", "c")
x

x <- 1:5
x
```

---
# Let's practice

- Create a variable called vector_1 that contains the number 300

- Create a variable called vector_2 that contains the numbers 100:500 

- Create a variable called vector_3 that contains the letters "a" to "e"

- Create a variable called vector_4 that contains your name, age, and the city where you were born.

---
## Using the seq() function

```{r}
x <- seq(1:10)
x

x <- seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)
x
```

- Write a vector with the numbers 1 to 500 in steps of 10

---
# Vector features

- Vectors have only one dimension (length)

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
length(x)
```

---
- All vector components must be the same type

    - Numeric
    - Integer
    - Double
    - Character
    - Factor
    - Logical

---
- Numeric
```{r}
x_num <- c(1, 2, 3)
class(x_num)
```

--
- Integer
```{r}
x_int <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
class(x_int)
```

---
- Double
```{r}
x_dbl <- c(1, 2.5, 3.1)
typeof(x_dbl)
```

--
- Character
```{r}
x_chr <- c("a", "chair", "the window")
class(x_chr)
```

---
- Factor
```{r}
x_fct <- factor("mouse_a", "mouse_b", "mouse_c")
class(x_fct)
```

--
- Logical
```{r}
x_log <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
class(x_log)
```

---

- R finds a way to unify the data type 

```{r}
x <- c(1, "a", TRUE)
x
class(x)
```

What will be the class of these vectors?

```{r}
y <- c(5, 7, "airplanes")

z <- c(10, 30.5, TRUE)
```

---
## Converting one class to another using as. functions

```{r}
x <- c(1.9, 2, 0, 0)
class(x)

as.double(x)

as.integer(x)
```

---
## Converting one class to another using as. functions

```{r}
as.character(x)
as.factor(x)
as.logical(x)
```

---
# Missing values

- NA

```{r}
x <- c(1, "a", TRUE, NA)
x
```

- NaN

```{r,warning=FALSE}
x <- c(10, -1, NA)
log(x)
```

# How do we access the vector elements?

---
## Using an integer as index

Vector index in R starts at 1

```{r}
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
x

x[3] # Extracts the third element
```

---
```{r}
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Extracts index from 3 to 5
x[3:5]
```

--
```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")

# Extracts index 2 and 5
x[c(2,5)] 
```

---
# Let's practice

- Create a vector with numbers from 50 to 100 in steps of 5. 
  - Get the first 7 numbers. 
    
  - Get the last 8 numbers.

- Create a vector with letters "a" to "k".    

  - Get the letters c, d, and j
