## 1) Which of the following options are good variable names?

d) DEMOGRAPHICINFORMATION
e) incidenceRate


## Let's create some vectors

### 3) What is the class of vector c?

## Store the result of the following code in a new vector
d <- c(a,b,c)

### 4) What is the resulting class of the new vector?

## Let's create a vector that contains the weight of three patients:
patients_weight <- c(198, 165, 150)

### 5) How do you get the number of patients in the vector?

### 6) How would you get the weight of patient 2?
